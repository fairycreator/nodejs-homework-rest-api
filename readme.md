# REST API

Five tasks are logically interconnected and involve writing a REST API.

### Requirements for completing homework assignments:

1. To complete the homework assignment, use the following [boilerplate](https://github.com/goitacademy/nodejs-homework-template).
2. A separate branch is created for each homework assignment:

   - hw02-express ðŸ‘‰ [HW-2](./homework/homework-02/README.ua.md) ðŸ‘‰ [Notes](./homework/homework-02/README.info.md)
   - hw03-mongodb ðŸ‘‰ [HW-3](./homework/homework-03/README.ua.md) ðŸ‘‰ [Notes](./homework/homework-03/README.info.md)
   - hw04-auth ðŸ‘‰ [HW-4](./homework/homework-04/README.ua.md) ðŸ‘‰ [Notes](./homework/homework-04/README.info.md)
   - hw05-avatars ðŸ‘‰ [HW-5](./homework/homework-05/README.ua.md) ðŸ‘‰ [Notes](./homework/homework-05/README.info.md)
   - hw06-email ðŸ‘‰ [HW-6](./homework/homework-06/README.ua.md) ðŸ‘‰ [Notes](./homework/homework-06/README.info.md)

3. Each new branch should be created from master.
4. JS code is clean and understandable; formatting is done using Prettier.
5. Before pushing, code quality is checked using the npm run lint command.
6. Code meets the technical requirements of the project.
7. No unhandled errors occur when the code is executed.
8. The names of variables, properties, and methods start with a lowercase letter and are written in CamelCase notation. English nouns are used.
9. The name of a function or method contains a verb.
10. The project works correctly with the current LTS version of Node.

### Commands:

- `npm start` &mdash; start the server in production mode.
- `npm run start:dev` &mdash; start the server in development mode.
- `npm run lint` &mdash; run code quality checks with eslint. This should be done before each PR and fix all linter errors.
- `npm run lint:fix` &mdash; the same linter check, but with automatic corrections of simple errors.
- `npm test` &mdash; start the server in test mode.
